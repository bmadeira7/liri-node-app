Liri-Node-App - HomeWork #8

In this homework assignment, I attempt to create a command line interface app that will fetch and display:
 1.song information via Spotify (based on keywords)
 2.movie info via OMDB (based on movie name)
 3.concert information via Bands In Town (based on artist name)

 Spotify requires a client ID and client secret which I want to keep hidden so I put them in a .env file and used .gitignore to make sure they are not deployed 
 to my github.
